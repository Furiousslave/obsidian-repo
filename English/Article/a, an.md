Generally we use **a** or **an** with *singluar countable noun*

We use **a/an** when we first time talking about a thing. When we mention it again we use **the**:
- **A man** and **a woman** were settting opposite me. **The man** was American, but I think **the woman** was British.

We use **a/an** when we say what kind of thing or person we mean:
- We had dinner in **a** very nice restaurant
- Can you recommend **a** good restaurant?
- My sister is a dentist

We say 'once **a week**' / three times **a day** / $ 1.50 **a kilo**' etc.:
- I go to the cinema about once **a month**
- 'How much are those potatoes?' '$1.50 **a kilo**'
- Helen work eight hours **a day**, six days **a week**

We usually say **breakfast**/**lunch**/**dinner**
But we say ‘**a big** lunch’, ‘**a wonderful** dinner’, ‘**an early** breakfast’ etc.
