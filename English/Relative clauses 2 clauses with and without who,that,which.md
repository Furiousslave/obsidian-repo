We must use **who**/**that**/**which** when it is the *subject* of the relative clause. You cannot leave out **who**/**that**/**which** in these examples:
- **The woman who lives** next door to me is a doctor
- Where are **the keys that were** on the table?

When **who**/**that**/**which** is the *object*,we can leave it out. So we can say:
- **The woman I wanted to see** was away. or The woman **who** I wanted to see …
- Did you find **the keys you lost**? or … the keys that **you** lost?
- **The dress Lisa bought** doesn’t fit her very well. or The dress that **Lisa** bought …
- Is there **anything I can do**? or … anything **that** I can do?

Note the position of prepositions (**to**/**in**/**for** etc.) in relative clauses:
- Do you know the woman Tom is **talking to** ? (or … the woman **who**/**that** Tom is talking to)
- The bed I **slept in** wasn’t comfortable. (or The bed **that**/which **I** slept in …)
- Are these **the books you were looking for**? or Are these the books **that**/**which** you were …
- **The man I was sitting next to on the plane** talked all the time. or The man **who**/**that** I was sitting next to …

We say:
- **Everything** (that) **they said** was true. (not Everything what they said)
- I gave her **all the money** (that) **I had**. (not all the money what I had)
