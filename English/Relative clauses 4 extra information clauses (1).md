There are two types of relative clause. In these examples, the relative clauses are underlined. Compare:
**Type 1**
- The woman <u>who lives next door to me</u> is a doctor.
- Grace works for a company <u>that makes furniture</u>.
- We stayed at the hotel <u>(that) you recommended</u>.
In these examples, the relative clauses tell you which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means:
- ‘The woman **who lives next door to me**’ tells us which woman.
- ‘A company **that makes furniture**’ tells us what kind of company
- The hotel **(that) you recommended**’ tells us which hotel.
We do not use commas (,) with these clauses:
- We know a lot of people <u>who live in London</u>.
**Type 2**
- My brother Ben, <u>who lives in Hong Kong</u>, is an architect.
- Anna told me about her new job, <u>which she’s enjoying a lot</u>.
- We stayed at the Park Hotel, <u>which a friend of ours recommended</u>.
In these examples, the relative clauses do not tell you which person or thing the speaker means. We already know which thing or person is meant: ‘My brother Ben’, ‘Anna’s new job’ and ‘the Park Hotel’.The relative clauses in these sentences give us *extra information* about the person or thing.
We use commas (,) with these clauses:
- My brother Ben, <u>who lives in Hong Kong</u>, is an architect.

In both types of relative clause we use who for people and which for things. But:
**Type 1**
We can use **that**:
- Do you know anyone **who**/**that** speaks French and Italian?
- Grace works for a company **which**/**that** makes furniture.
We can leave out who/which/that when it is the object:
- We stayed at **the hotel** (that/which) **you recommended**.
- This morning I met **somebody** (who/that) **I hadn’t seen for ages**.
We do not often use **whom** in this type of clause
**Type 2**
We cannot use **that**:
- John, **who** speaks French and Italian, works as a tour guide. (not that speaks)
- Anna told me about her new job, **which** she’s enjoying a lot.
We cannot leave out who or which:
- We stayed at the Park Hotel, **which** a friend of ours recommended.
- This morning I met Chris, **who** I hadn’t seen for ages.
We can use **whom** for people (when it is the object):
- This morning I met Chris, **whom** I hadn’t seen for ages

In both types of relative clause we can use **whose** and **where**:
**Type 1**
- We helped some people **whose** car had broken down.
- What’s the name of the place **where** you went on holiday?
**Type 2**
- Lisa, **whose** car had broken down, was in a very bad mood.
- Kate has just been to Sweden, **where** her daughter lives.
