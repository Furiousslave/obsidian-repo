**Each** and **every** are similar. Oft en it is possible to use **each** or **every**:
- **Each** time I see you, you look diff erent. or **Every** time I see you …
But **each** and **every** are not exactly the same
We use **each** when we think of things separately, one by one.

**Each** is more usual for a small number:
- There were four books on the table. **Each book** was a diff erent colour.

We use **every** when we think of things as a group. The meaning is similar to **all**.

**Every** is more usual for a large number:
- Kate loves reading. She has read **every book** in the library. (= all the books)

**Each** (but not every) **can** be used for two things:
- In football, **each team** has eleven players. (not every team)
We use **every** (not **each**) to say how often something happens:
- ‘How oft en do you use your car?’ ‘**Every day**.’ (not Each day)

Or you can use **each one**:

We say **each of** (**the**/**these**/**them** … etc.):
- **Each of the** books was a diff erent colour. (not each of books)
- **Each of them** was a diff erent colour
- Read **each of these** sentences carefully.
We use **every** with a noun:
- She’s read **every book** in the library
We don’t use **every** alone, but you can say **every one**:
- a: Have you read all these books? B: Yes, **every one**.
We say **every one of** … (but not every of):
- I’ve read **every one of those** books. (not every of those books)

- These oranges are **40 pence each**. (**each** = for one orange
