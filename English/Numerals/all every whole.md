**everybody**/**everyone**/**everything** and all
We say:
- **Everybody** was happy. or **Everyone** was happy. (not all were happy)
- He thinks he knows **everything**. (not knows all)
- Our holiday was a disaster. **Everything** went wrong. (not all went wrong)
We do not often use **all** alone in this way. We do not say ‘all were happy’, ‘he knows all’ etc.
We use **all** in the following ways:
**all** + noun (**all cars**, **all my money** etc.) - **All my friends** were happy
**all of** + **us**/**you**/**them** - **All of us** were happy.
**we**/**you**/**they** … **all** … - **We** were **all** happy.
**all about** … - He knows **all about computers**.
**all** … = the only thing(s) - **All I’ve eaten today** is a banana. (= the only thing I’ve eaten today)

**whole** and **all**
**Whole** = complete, entire. We use **whole** mostly with singular nouns:
- Did you read **the whole book**? (= all the book, not just a part of it)
- Emily has lived **her whole life** in the same town.
- I was so hungry, I ate **a whole packet** of biscuits. (= a complete packet)
We do not normally use **whole** with uncountable nouns (**water**, **food**, **money** etc.). We say:
- Did you spend **all the money** I gave you? (not the whole money
- I read **all the information** carefully. (not the whole information)

**every day** / **all day** / **the whole day**
We use **every** to say how often something happens (**every day** / **every ten minutes** etc.):
- When we were on holiday, we went to the beach **every day**. (not all days)
- The bus service is excellent. There’s a bus **every ten minutes**.
- We don’t see each other very often – about **every six months**
**All day** or **the whole** day = the complete day from beginning to end:
- We spent **all day** on the beach. or We spent **the whole day** …
- Dan was very quiet. He didn’t say a word **all evening**. or … **the whole evening**.
Note that we say **all day** (not all the day), **all week** (not all the week) etc.
Compare **all the time** and **every time**:
- They never go out. They are at home **all the time**. (= always, continuously)
- **Every time** I see you, you look different. (= each time, on every occasion)

**Every**/**everybody**/**everyone**/**everything** are singular words, so we use a singular verb:
- **Every** seat in the theatre **was** taken
- **Everybody** has **arrived**. (not have arrived)
But we use **they**/**them**/**their** after **everybody**/**everyone**:
- **Everybody** said they **enjoyed** **themselves**. (= everybody enjoyed himself or herself)
