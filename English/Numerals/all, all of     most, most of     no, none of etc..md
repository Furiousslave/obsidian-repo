**all** **some** **any** **most** **much** **many** **(a) little** **(a) few** **no**
We can use these words with a noun (**some food** / **few books** etc.):
- **All cars** have wheels
- **Some cars** can go faster than others
- **Many people** drive too fast
- I go away **most weekends**.
- I feel really tired. I’ve got **no energy**.
We do not say ‘all of cars’, ‘some of people’ etc. :
- **Some people** learn more easily than others. (not Some of people)

**all half some any most much many (a) little (a) few none**
We can use these words with **of** (**some of** / **most of** etc.):
**some of**         **the**...    **my**....
**most of**      +  **this**....   **these**....
**none of** etc.    **that**... **those**...etc.
So we can say:
some **of the people**, some **of those people** (but not some of people)
most **of my time**, most **of the time** (but not most of time)
- **Some of the people** **I work with** are very strange.
- **None of this money** is mine
- Have you read **any of these books**?
- I was ill yesterday. I spent **most of the day** in bed.
We don’t need **of** after **all** or **half**. So we can say:
- **All my friends** live near here. or All **of** my friends …
- **Half this money** is mine. or Half **of** this money …
Compare:
- **All flowers** are beautiful. (= all flowers in general) **All** (**of**) **these** **flowers** are beautiful. (= a specific group of flowers
- **Most problems** have a solution. (= most problems in general) We were able to solve **most of the problems we had**. (= a specific group of problems)

We can use **all of** / **some of** / **none of** etc. + **it**/**us**/**you**/**them**:
**all of**
**some of**       **it**
**any of**      +  **us**
**most of**        **you**
**none of**        **them**
etc.
- a: Do you like this music? b: **Some of it**. Not **all of it**
- a: How many of these people do you know? b: **None of them**. / **A few of them**.
- Do **any of you** want to come to a party tonight? (said to more than 2 people)
We say: **all of us** / **all of you** / **half of it** / **half of them** etc. We need **of** before **it**/**us**/**you**/**them**:
- **All of us** were late. (not all us)
- I haven’t finished the book yet. I’ve only read **half of it**. (not half it)

We also use **some**/**most** etc. alone, without a noun:
- Some cars have four doors and **some** have two.
- A few of the shops were open, but **most** (of them) were closed
- Half this money is mine, and **half** (of it) is yours. (not the half)
