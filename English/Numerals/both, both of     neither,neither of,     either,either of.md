We use **both**/**neither**/**either** for *two* things. 
We can use these words with a noun (both books, neither book etc.)

For example, you are going out to eat. There are two possible restaurants. You say:
- **Both restaurants** are good. (not the both restaurants)
- **Neither restaurant** is expensive.
- We can go to **either restaurant**. I don’t mind. (= one or the other, it doesn’t matter which)
- I haven’t been to **either restaurant** before. (= not one or the other
We can also use **both**/**neither**/**either** without a noun:
- ‘Which do you prefer, basketball or tennis?’ ‘It’s hard to say. I like **both**.’
- ‘Is your friend British or American?’ ‘**Neither**. She’s Australian.’
- ‘Do you want tea or coffee?’ ‘**Either**. I don’t mind.’

**both of** … / **neither of** … / **either of** …
We use **both of** / **neither of** / **either of** + **the**/**these**/**my**/**Tom’s** … etc. So we say ‘both of **the** restaurants’, ‘both of **those** restaurants’ etc. (but not both of restaurants):
- **Both of these** restaurants are good.
- **Neither of the** restaurants we went to was expensive.
- I haven’t been to **either of those** restaurants.
We don’t need of after both. So we can say:
- **Both of these** restaurants are good. or **Both these** restaurants are good.
We also use **both of** / **neither of** / **either of** + **us**/**you**/them**:**
- (talking to two people) Can **either of you** speak Russian?
- I asked two people how to get to the station, but **neither of them** knew
We say ‘both **of**’ before **us**/**you**/**them** (we need to use **of**):
- **Both of us** were tired. (not Both us were …)
After **neither of** … a verb can be singular or plural:
- Neither of them **is** at home. or Neither of them **are** at home

We can say:
**both**... **and**...:
- **Both** Chris **and** Paul were late.
- I was **both** tired **and** hungry when I arrived home.
**neither** … **nor** …:
- **Neither** Chris nor **Paul** came to the party
- There was an accident outside our house, but we **neither** saw nor **heard** anything.
**either** … **or** …:
- I’m not sure where Maria’s from. She’s **either** Spanish **or** Italian.
- **Either** you apologise, **or** I’ll never speak to you again.

Compare **either**/**neither**/both (two things) and **any**/**none**/**all** (more than two):
There are **two** good hotels here.  There are **many** good hotels here
You could stay at **either** of them.  You could stay at **any** of them.
We tried **two** hotels.  We tried **a lot of** hotels.
**Neither** of them had a room.  **None** of them had a room
**Both** of them were full.  **All** of them were full.
