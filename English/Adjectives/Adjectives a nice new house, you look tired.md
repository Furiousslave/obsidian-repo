Sometimes we use two or more adjectives together:
- My brother lives in a **nice new** house.
- In the kitchen there was a **beautiful large** round wooden table.
Adjectives like **new**/**large**/**round**/**wooden** are fact adjectives. They give us information about age, size, colour etc. 
Adjectives like **nice**/**beautiful** are opinion adjectives. They tell us what the speaker thinks of something or somebody.
Opinion adjectives usually go before fact adjectives

Sometimes we use two or more fact adjectives together. Usually (not always) we put fact adjectives in this order:
how big? -> how old? -> what colour? -> where from? -> what is it made of ? -> NOUN
Adjectives of size and length (**big**/**small**/**tall**/**short**/**long** etc.) usually go before adjectives of shape and width (**round**/**fat**/**thin**/**slim**/**wide** etc.):
- a **large** **round** table
- a **tall** **thin** gir
- a **long** **narrow** street
When there are two or more colour adjectives, we use **and**:
- a black and white dress 
- a red, white and green flag
This does not usually happen with other adjectives before a noun: 
- a **long black** dress (not a long and black dress

We use adjectives after **be**/**get**/**become**/**seem**:
- **Be careful**!
- I’**m tired** and I’**m getting hungry**.
- As the film went on, it **became** more and more **boring**
- Your friend **seems** very **nice**.
We also use adjectives to say how somebody/something looks, feels, sounds, tastes or smells: 
- You **look tired**. / I **feel tired**. / She **sounds tired**. 
- The dinner **smells good**. 
- This tea **tastes** a bit **strange**
We say ‘the **first two** days’, ‘the **next few** weeks’, ‘the **last ten** minutes’ etc. : 
- I didn’t enjoy the **first two** days of the course. (not the two first days) 
- They’ll be away for the **next few** weeks. (not the few next weeks)
