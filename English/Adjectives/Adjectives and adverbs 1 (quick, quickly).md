We can say: 
- Our holiday was too short – the time passed very **quickly**. 
- Two people were **seriously** injured in the accident.
**Quickly** and **seriously** are *adverbs*. Many adverbs are adjective + -**ly**

*Adjectives* (**quick**/**careful** etc.) tell us about a noun (somebody or something). We use adjectives before nouns:
- Sam is a **careful** **driver**. (not a carefully driver)
- We didn’t go out because of the **heavy** **rain**.
*Adverbs* (**quickly**/**carefully** etc.) tell us about a verb (how somebody does something or how something happens): 
- Sam **drove carefully** along the narrow road. (not drove careful) 
- We didn’t go out because it was **raining heavily**. (not raining heavy)

We can also use adverbs before adjectives and other adverbs. For example:
- **reasonably** cheap (adverb + adjective)
- **terribly** sorry (adverb + adjective) 
- **incredibly** quickly (adverb + adverb)
We can also use an adverb before a past participle (**injured**/**organised**/**written** etc.): 
- Two people were **seriously injured** in the accident. (not serious injured) 
- The conference was **badly organised**.
