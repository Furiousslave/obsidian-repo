We use **-’s** (apostrophe + **s**) mostly for people or animals:
- **Tom’s** computer isn’t working. (not the computer of Tom)
- How old are **Chris’s** children? (not the children of Chris)
- What’s (= What is) **your sister’s** name?
- What’s **Tom’s sister’s** name?
- Be careful. Don’t step on **the cat’s** tail.

We do not use -’s after a long group of words. So we say: 
**my friend’s** mother
but the mother **of the man we met yesterday** (not the man we met yesterday’s mother)

With a singular noun we use -’s:
- my **sister’s** room (= her **room** – one sister)
- **Mr Carter’s** house (= **his** house)

With a plural noun (sister**s**, friend**s** etc.) we put an apostrophe (**’**) after **s**: 
- **my sisters’** room (= their room – two or more sisters) 
- **the Carters’** house (= their house – Mr and Mrs Carter

If a plural noun does not end in -**s** (for example **men**/**women**/**children**/**people**) we use -**’s**: 
- the **men’s** changing room 
- a **children’s** book (= a book for children)

For things, ideas etc., we normally use **of**:
- the temperature **of the water** (not the water’s temperature)
- the name **of the book**
- the owner **of the restaurant**

We say **the beginning/end/middle of** … / **the top**/**bottom of** … / **the front**/**back**/**side of** … :
- **the beginning of** the month (not the month’s beginning)
- **the top of** the hill
- **the back of** the car

We can usually use -’s or of … for an organisation (= a group of people). So we can say:
- **the government’s** decision or the decision **of the government**
- t**he company’s** success or the success **of the company**

We also use -’s for places. So you we say:
- **the city’s** streets
- **the world’s** population I
- **Italy’s** prime minister

We use -’s with time words (**yesterday** / **next week** etc.):
- Do you still have **yesterday’s** newspaper?
- **Next week’s** meeting has been cancelled.
In the same way, we can say **today’s** / **tomorrow’s** / **this evening’s** / **Monday’s** etc.

We also use -**’s** (or -**s’** with plural words) with periods of time:
- I’ve got **a week’s holiday** starting on Monday.
- Julia has got **three weeks’** holiday
- I live near the station – it’s only **ten minutes’** walk.
