Sometimes we use a *plural* noun for one thing that has two parts. For example:
- **trousers** (two legs) also **jeans**/**tights**/**shorts**/**pants**
- **pyjamas** (top and bottom)
- **glasses**
- **binoculars**
- **scissors**
- **etc**.
These words are plural, so they take a plural verb:
- My trousers **are** too long. (not My trousers is)
We can also use **a pair of** + these words:
- **Those are** nice jeans **or** Tha**t’s a** nice **pair of** jeans. (not a nice jeans)
- I need **some** new glasses or I need **a** new **pair of** glasses.

Some nouns end in **-ics**, but are not usually plural. For example:
- athletics
- gymnastics
- economics
- politics
- physics
- maths  (= mathematics)
**Gymnastics is** my favourite sport. (not Gymnastics are)

Some words that end in **-s** can be singular or plural. For example:
- **means**
- **a means** of transport
- **many means** of transport

Some singular nouns are often used with a plural verb. For example:
- **audince**
- **committee**
- **company**
- **family**
- **firm**
- **government**
- **staff**
- **team**
These nouns are all groups of people. We often think of them as a number of people (= they), not as one thing (= it). So we often use a plural verb:
- **The government** (= they) **have decided** to increase taxes
- **The staff** at the company (= they) are **not** happy with **their** working conditions.
In the same way, we often use a plural verb after the name of a company or a sports team:
- **Shell have** increased the price of petrol.
- **Italy are** playing Brazil next Sunday (in a football match).
We use a plural verb with **police**:
- **The police are** investigating the crime, but haven’t arrested anyone yet. (not The police is … hasn’t)
We say **a police officer** / **a policeman** / **a policewoman** (not a police).

We do not often use the plural of **person** (‘persons’). We normally use **people** (a plural word):
- He’s **a** nice **person**. but They are nice **people**. (not nice persons)
- **Many people don’t** have enough to eat. (not Many people doesn’t)

We think of a sum of money, a period of time, a distance etc. as one thing. So we use a singular verb:
- **Fifty thousand pounds** (= it) **was** stolen in the robbery. (not were stolen)
- **Three years** (= it) **is** a long time to be without a job. (not Three years are)
- **Two miles isn’t** very far to walk.
