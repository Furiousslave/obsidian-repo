*preposition* + **whom**/**which**
We can use a *preposition* + **whom** (for people) and **which** (for things)
So we can say:
- **to whom**
- **with whom**
- **about whom**
- **of which**
- **without which**
- **from which**
- **etc**
- Mr Lee, **to whom I spoke** at the meeting, is interested in our proposal.
- Fortunately we had a good map, **without which** we would have got lost
In spoken English we often keep the preposition after the verb in the relative clause:
- Katherine told me she works for a company called ‘Latoma’, **which** I’d never **heard** of before.
We do not use **whom** when the preposition is in this position:
- Mr Lee, **who I spoke to** at the meeting, is interested in our proposal. (not Mr Lee, whom I spoke to …)

**all of** / **most of** etc. + **whom**/**which**
We can say:
- Helen has three brothers, **all of whom** are married.
- They asked me a lot of questions, **most of which** I couldn’t answer.
In the same way you can say:
- **many of whom** **some of whom** n**either of whom** etc. (for people)
- **none of which** **both of which** **one of which** etc. (for things)
- Martin tried on three jackets, **none of which** fitted him
- Two men, **neither of whom** I had seen before, came into the office.
- They have three cars, **two of which** they rarely use.
- Sue has a lot of friends, **many of whom** she was at school with.
We can also say:
- **the cause of which** **the name of which** etc
- The house was damaged in a fire, **the cause of which** was never established.
- We stayed at a beautiful hotel, **the name of which** I don’t remember now.

**which** (not what)
In this example, **which** = ‘the fact that Joe got the job’. We use **which** (not what) in sentences like these:
- Sarah couldn’t meet us, **which** was a shame. (not what was a shame)
- The weather was good, **which** we hadn’t expected. (not what we hadn’t expected)
