We use **sorry for** (doing) to apologise for something:
- I'm sorry for saying bad things about you
- I'm sorry for making so much noise last night

We use sorry to ... to say that we regret something that happens:
- We were sorry to hear that you can't come to the wedding.
- I'll be sorry to see him go

We also say 'I'm sorry to ...' to apologise at the time we do something:
- I'm sorry to bother you, but i need to ask you a question
