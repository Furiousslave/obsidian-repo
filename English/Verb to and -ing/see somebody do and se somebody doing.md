I **saw him do something** = he **did** something a I saw this
I saw complete action from start to finish:

In the same way, we can say:
**hear**
**listen** **to**      somebody **do** something         
**watch**         something **happen**
**feel**

I **saw him doing** something = he **was doing** something and I saw this.
I saw him in the middle of doing something (not from start to finish):

In the same way, we can say:
**hear**
**listen** **to**  
**watch**          somebody **doing** something
**feel**              something **happening**
**smell**
**find**
