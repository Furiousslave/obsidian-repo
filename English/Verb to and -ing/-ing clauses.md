We can use **-ing** when two things happen at the same time:
- Laura had an accident driving to work
- I got very wet walking in the rain
- Emily hurt her back trying to lift a heavy box

When action happens before something else, we use **having (done)** for the first action:
- Having finishd her work, Katherine left the office and went home
- Having bougth out tickets, we went into the theatre and took our seats
- Having said he was hungry, Joe now says he doesn't want to eat anything

We can also say **after -ing**:
- After finishing her work, she went home
