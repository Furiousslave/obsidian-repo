**whose**
We use **whose** mostly for people:
- A widow is a woman **whose husband is dead**. (**her** husband is dead)
- I met someone **whose brother I went to school with**. (I went to school with **his**/**her** brother)
Compare **who** and **whose**:
- I met a man **who** knows you. (**he** knows you)
- I met a man **whose sister** knows you. (his **sister** knows you)
Do not confuse **whose** and **who’s**. The pronunciation is the same, but **who’s** = who **is** or who **has**:
- I have a friend **who’s learning** Arabic. (**who’s** = who **is**)
- I have a friend **who’s** just **started** learning Arabic. **(who’s** = **who has**)
- I have a friend **whose** sister is learning Arabic.

**whom**
**Whom** is possible instead of **who** when it is the object of the verb:
- George is a person **whom I admire** very much. (I admire **him**)
We can also use a preposition + **whom** (**to whom** / **from whom** / **with whom** etc.):
- It’s important to have friends **with whom** you can relax. (you can relax **with them**)
**Whom** is a formal word and we do not oft en use it in spoken English. We usually prefer to say:
- **a person I admire** a lot or a person **who**/**that** I admire a lot
- **friends you can relax with** or friends **who**/**that** you can relax with

**where**
We use **where** in a relative clause to talk about a place:
- I recently went back to **the town where** I grew up. (I grew up **there**)
- **The restaurant where** we had lunch was near the airport.
- I would like to live in **a place where** there is plenty of sunshine.

**the day**, **the time**, **the reason** …
We say ‘**the day** we got married’, ‘**the year** I was born’, ‘**the last** time they met’ etc. :
- I can’t meet you on Friday. That’s **the day I’m going away**
- **The last time I saw her**, she looked great.
We can also use **that**:
- The last time **that** I saw her, she looked great
We say ‘**the reason** I’m calling you’, ‘**the reason** she didn’t get the job’ etc.
- **The reason I’m calling you** is to ask your advice.
We can also use **that**:
- The reason **that** I’m calling you … or The reason **why** I’m calling you …
