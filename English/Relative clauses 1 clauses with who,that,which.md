A *clause* is a part of a sentence. A *relative clause* tells us which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means:
- the woman **who lives next door to me** (‘who lives next door to me’ tells us which woman)
- people **who complain all the time** (‘who complain all the time’ tells us what kind of people
We use **who** in a relative clause for people (not things):
- **The woman who** lives next door to me is a doctor.
- I don’t like **people who** complain all the time.
- An architect is **someone who** designs buildings
- What was the name of **the person who** called?
- Do you know **anyone who** wants to buy a car?
We also use **that** for people, but not **which**:
- The woman **that lives next door to me** is a doctor. (not the woman which)
Sometimes you must use **who** (not that) for people

When we are talking about things, we use **that** or **which** (not who) in a relative clause:
- I don’t like **stories that** have unhappy endings. or … **stories which** have unhappy endings.
- Grace works for a company **that** makes furniture. or … **a company which** makes furniture.
- **The machine that** broke down is working again now. or **The machine which** broke down …
In these examples **that** is more usual than **which**, but sometimes you must use **which**

In relative clauses we use **who**/**that**/**which**, not **he**/**she**/**they**/**it**. Compare
- I met a Canadian woman at the party. **She** is an English teacher. (2 sentences) I met **a Canadian woman who** is an English teacher. (1 sentence)
- I can’t find the keys. **They** were on the table. Where are **the keys that** were on the table? (not the keys they were)

**What** = the thing(s) that 
Compare **what** and **that**:
- **What happened** was my fault. (= the thing that happened)
but
- Everything **that happened** was my fault. (not Everything what happened)
- The machine that broke down is now working again. (not The machine what broke down)
