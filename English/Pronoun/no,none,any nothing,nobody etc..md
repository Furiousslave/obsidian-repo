We use **no** + noun (**no bus**, **no shops** etc.).
**no** = **not a** or **not any**:
- We had to walk home. There was **no bus**. (= There **wasn’t a** bus.)
- Sarah will have **no trouble** finding a job. (= Sarah **won’t** have any **trouble** …)
- There were **no shops** open. (= There **weren’t any** shops open.)
We can use **no** + noun at the beginning of a sentence:
- **No reason** was given for the change of plan

We use **none** without a noun:
- ‘How much money do you have?’ ‘**None**.’ (= no money)
- All the tickets have been sold. There are **none** left. (= no tickets left)
Or we use **none** of … :
- This money is all yours. **None of** it is mine
After **none of** + plural (none of **the students**, none of **them** etc.) the verb can be singular or plural:
- None of the students **were** happy. or None of the students **was** happy

**nothing** **nobody**/**no-one** **nowhere**
We can use these words at the beginning of a sentence or alone (as answers to questions):
- ‘What’s going to happen?’ ‘**Nobody** knows. / **No-one** knows.’
- ‘What happened?’ ‘**Nothing**.’
- ‘Where are you going?’ ‘**Nowhere**. I’m staying here.’
We can also use these words after a verb, especially after **be** and **have**:
- The house is empty. There’s **nobody** living there.
- We **had nothing** to eat.
**nothing**/**nobody** etc. = not **+** **anything**/**anybody** etc. :
- I said **nothing**. = I **didn’t** say **anything**.
- Jane told **nobody** about her plans. = Jane **didn’t** tell **anybody** about her plans.
- They have **nowhere** to live. = They **don’t** have **anywhere** to live
With **nothing**/**nobody** etc., we do not use a negative verb **(isn’t**, **didn’t** etc.):
- I **said** nothing. (not I didn’t say nothing)

After **nobody**/**no-one** we can use **they**/**them**/**their**:
- **Nobody** is perfect, are they? (= is he or she perfect?)
- **No-one** did what I asked **them** to do. (= him or her)
- **Nobody** in the class did **their** homework. (= his or her homework)

Sometimes **any**/**anything**/**anybody** etc. means ‘it doesn’t matter which/what/who’. Compare **no**- and **any**-:
- There was **no** bus, so we walked home. You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn’t matter which bus)
- ‘What do you want to eat?’ ‘**Nothing**. I’m not hungry.’ I’m so hungry. I could eat **anything**. (= it doesn’t matter what)
- It’s a difficult job. **Nobody** wants to do it. It’s a very easy job. **Anybody** can do it. (= it doesn’t matter who
