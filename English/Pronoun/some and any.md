In general we use **some** (also **somebody**/**someone**/something) in positive sentences and **any** (also **anybody** etc.) in negative sentences:

|                **some**                |                any                 |
|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
|       We **bought some** flowers       |     We **didn’t** buy **any** flowers      |
| He’s busy. He **has some** work to do. | He’s lazy. He **never** does any **work**. |
|    There**’s somebody** at the door    |  There **isn’t anybody** at the door.  |
|      I **want something** to eat.      |   I **don’t** want **anything** to eat.    |
We use **any** in the following sentences because the meaning is negative:
- She went out **without any** money. (she **didn’t** take **any** money with her)
- He **refused** to eat **anything**. (he **didn’t** eat **anything**)
- It’s a very easy exam. **Hardly anybody** fails. (= almost **nobody** fails)

We use both **some** and any **in** questions. We use **some**/**somebody**/**something** to talk about a person or thing that we know exists, or we think exists:
- Are you waiting for **somebody**? (I think you are waiting for somebody)

We use **some** in questions when we ask for or offer things:
- Can I have **some** sugar, please? (there is probably some sugar that I can have)
- Would you like **something** to eat? (there is something to eat)

But in most questions, we use any. We do not know if the thing or person exists:
- Do you have **any** luggage? (maybe you do, maybe not)
- Is there **anybody** in the house? (maybe there is, maybe not)

We can use **if** + **any**:
- Let me know **if** you need **anything**
- **If** **anyone** has any **questions**, I’ll be pleased to answer them

The following sentences have the idea of **if**:
- I’m sorry for **any** trouble I’ve caused. (= **if** I have caused **any** trouble)
- The police want to speak to **anyone** who saw the accident. (= **if** there is **anyone**)

We also use **any** with the meaning ‘it doesn’t matter which’:
- You can take **any** bus. They all go to the centre. (= it doesn’t matter which bus you take)
- Come and see me **any** time you want.

We use **anybody**/**anyone**/**anything**/**anywhere** in the same way:
- We forgot to lock the door. **Anybody** could have come in.

Compare **some**- and **any**-:
- a: I’m hungry. I want **something** to eat.
- b: What would you like?
- I don’t mind. **Anything**. (= it doesn’t matter what)
- Let’s go out **somewhere**.
- : Where shall we go?
- **Anywhere**. I just want to go out.

**Somebody**/**someone**/**anybody**/anyone are singular words:
- **Someone** is here to see you.
But we use **they**/**them**/their after these words:
- **Someone** has forgotten **their** umbrella. (= his or her umbrella)
- If **anybody** wants to leave early, **they** can. (= he or she can)
