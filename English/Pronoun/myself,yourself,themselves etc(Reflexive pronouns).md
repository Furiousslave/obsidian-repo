We use **myself**/**yourself**/**himself** etc. (reflexive pronouns) when the subject and object are the same:
- **Steve** introduced **himself**

The reflexive pronouns are:
- singular: (-**self**) **myself** **yourself** (one person) **himself**/**herself**/**itself**
- plural (-**selves**) **ourselves** **yourselves** (more than one) **themselves**

We do not use **myself** etc. aft er **feel**/**relax**/**concentrate**/meet**:**
- I **feel** nervous. I can’t relax**.**
- You need to **concentrate**. (not concentrate yourself)
- What time shall we **meet** tomorrow?

Normally we do not use **myself** etc. after **wash**/**shave**/**dress**:
- He got up, **washed**, **shaved** and **dressed**. (not washed himself etc.)
We can also say **get dressed** (He **got dressed**).

Compare **-selves** and **each other**:
- Kate and Joe stood in front of the mirror and looked at **themselves**. (= Kate and Joe together looked at Kate and Joe)
- Kate looked at Joe, and Joe looked at Kate. They looked at **each other**

We can use **one another** instead of **each other**:
- How long have you and Ben known **each other**? or … known **one another**?
- Sue and Alice don’t like **each other**. or … don’t like **one another**.
- Do they live near **each other**? or … near **one another**?

We also use **myself**/**yourself** etc. in another way. For example:
- ‘Who repaired your bike?’ ‘**I** repaired it **myself**.’
**I repaired it myself** = I repaired it, not another person. Here, **myself** is used to emphasise ‘I’ (= it makes it stronger). Some more examples:
- I’m not going to do your work for you. **You** can do it **yourself**. (= you, not me)
- **Let’s** paint the house **ourselves**. It will be much cheaper.
- **The film itself** wasn’t very good, but I loved the music
- I don’t think Lisa will get the job she applied for. **Lisa** doesn’t think so **herself**. or **Lisa herself** doesn’t think so.
