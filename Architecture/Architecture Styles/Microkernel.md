# Topology
The microkernel architecture style is a relatively simple monolithic architecture consisting of two architecture components: a core system and plug-in components. Application logic is divided between independent plug-in components and the basic core system, providing extensibility, adaptability, and isolation of application features and custom processing logic. Figure illustrates the basic topology of the microkernel architecture style.

## Core System
The _core system_ is formally defined as the minimal functionality required to run the system. The Eclipse IDE is a good example of this. The core system of Eclipse is just a basic text editor: open a file, change some text, and save the file. It’s not until you add plug-ins that Eclipse starts becoming a usable product. However, another definition of the core system is the happy path (general processing flow) through the application, with little or no custom processing. Removing the cyclomatic complexity of the core system and placing it into separate plug-in components allows for better extensibility and maintainability, as well as increased testability
# Registry
The core system needs to know about which plug-in modules are available and how to get to them. One common way of implementing this is through a plug-in registry. This registry contains information about each plug-in module, including things like its name, data contract, and remote access protocol details (depending on how the plug-in is connected to the core system). For example, a plug-in for tax software that flags high-risk tax audit items might have a registry entry that contains the name of the service (AuditChecker), the data contract (input data and output data), and the contract format (XML).

The registry can be as simple as an internal map structure owned by the core system containing a key and the plug-in component reference, or it can be as complex as a registry and discovery tool either embedded within the core system or deployed externally (such as [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/) or [Consul](https://www.consul.io/)).
# Examples and Use Cases
Most of the tools used for developing and releasing software are implemented using the microkernel architecture. Some examples include the [Eclipse IDE](https://www.eclipse.org/ide), [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/), [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), and [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), to name a few). Internet web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox are another common product example using the microkernel architecture: viewers and other plug-ins add additional capabilities that are not otherwise found in the basic browser representing the core system. The examples are endless for product-based software, but what about large business applications? The microkernel architecture applies to these situations as well. To illustrate this point, consider an insurance company example involving insurance claims processing.

Claims processing is a very complicated process. Each jurisdiction has different rules and regulations for what is and isn’t allowed in an insurance claim. For example, some jurisdictions (e.g., states) allow free windshield replacement if your windshield is damaged by a rock, whereas other states do not. This creates an almost infinite set of conditions for a standard claims process.

Most insurance claims applications leverage large and complex rules engines to handle much of this complexity. However, these rules engines can grow into a complex big ball of mud where changing one rule impacts other rules, or making a simple rule change requires an army of analysts, developers, and testers to make sure nothing is broken by a simple change. Using the microkernel architecture pattern can solve many of these issues.

The claims rules for each jurisdiction can be contained in separate standalone plug-in components (implemented as source code or a specific rules engine instance accessed by the plug-in component). This way, rules can be added, removed, or changed for a particular jurisdiction without impacting any other part of the system. Furthermore, new jurisdictions can be added and removed without impacting other parts of the system. The core system in this example would be the standard process for filing and processing a claim, something that doesn’t change often.

Another example of a large and complex business application that can leverage the microkernel architecture is tax preparation software. For example, the United States has a basic two-page tax form called the 1040 form that contains a summary of all the information needed to calculate a person’s tax liability. Each line in the 1040 tax form has a single number that requires many other forms and worksheets to arrive at that single number (such as gross income). Each of these additional forms and worksheets can be implemented as a plug-in component, with the 1040 summary tax form being the core system (the driver). This way, changes to tax law can be isolated to an independent plug-in component, making changes easier and less risky.
# Architecture Characteristics Ratings
![[Pasted image 20240407170057.png]]
**Similar to the layered architecture style, simplicity and overall cost are the main strengths of the microkernel architecture style, and scalability, fault tolerance, and extensibility its main weaknesses**. These weaknesses are due to **the typical monolithic deployments found with the microkernel architecture**. Also, like the layered architecture style, the number of quanta is always singular (one) because all requests must go through the core system to get to independent plug-in components. That’s where the similarities end.

The microkernel architecture style is unique in that it is the only architecture style that can be both domain partitioned _and_ technically partitioned. While most microkernel architectures are technically partitioned, the domain partitioning aspect comes about mostly through a strong domain-to-architecture isomorphism. For example, problems that require different configurations for each location or client match extremely well with this architecture style. Another example is a product or application that places a strong emphasis on user customization and feature extensibility (such as Jira or an IDE like Eclipse).

**Testability, deployability, and reliability rate a little above average (three stars), primarily because functionality can be isolated to independent plug-in components**. If done right, this reduces the overall testing scope of changes and also reduces overall risk of deployment, particularly if plug-in components are deployed in a runtime fashion.

**Modularity and extensibility also rate a little above average (three stars). With the microkernel architecture style, additional functionality can be added, removed, and changed through independent, self-contained plug-in components, thereby making it relatively easy to extend and enhance applications created using this architecture style and allowing teams to respond to changes much faster**. Consider the tax preparation software example from the previous section. If the US tax law changes (which it does all the time), requiring a new tax form, that new tax form can be created as a plug-in component and added to the application without much effort. Similarly, if a tax form or worksheet is no longer needed, that plug-in can simply be removed from the

**Performance is always an interesting characteristic to rate with the microkernel architecture style. We gave it three stars (a little above average) mostly because microkernel applications are generally small and don’t grow as big as most layered architectures**. Also, they don’t suffer as much from the architecture sinkhole anti-pattern discussed in [Chapter 10](httpsr2://id_qzpc_v_x_nlcn_nc_tmlra_x_rh_x_e_fwc_e_rhd_g_fc_um9hb_wlu_z1x_f_r_f_j_m_y_w_iu_v_ghvcml1b_v_jl_y_w_rlclxwd_w_jsa_w_nhd_glvbn_nc_mzk1_ym_nk_y_w_ut_zjll_o_c00_nj_zl_l_tkw_o_g_et_nm_ri_o_t_m5_nm_ri_o_d_bh_x_g_jvb2su_z_x_b1_yg--/xthoriumhttps/ip0.0.0.0/p/OEBPS/ch10.xhtml#ch-style-layered). Finally, microkernel architectures can be streamlined by unplugging unneeded functionality, therefore making the application run faster. A good example of this is [Wildfly](https://wildfly.org/) (previously the JBoss Application Server). By unplugging unnecessary functionality like clustering, caching, and messaging, the application server performs much faster than with these features in place.
